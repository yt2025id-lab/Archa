## What is Archa?

**Archa** is a decentralized rotating savings platform (arisan) built on [Mantle Network](https://www.mantle.xyz). We bring the traditional Indonesian arisan system to blockchain with enhanced security, transparency, and profitability through AI-powered yield optimization.

### The Vision

For decades, arisan has proven that trust can be built without banks. Now, we're taking it to the next level with:
- **AI** that optimizes yield from DeFi protocols
- **Smart contracts** that cannot lie or be manipulated
- **Blockchain** that records everything transparently

### Why Archa?

| Traditional Arisan | Archa |
|-------------------|-------|
| Risk of members running away | Collateral system prevents default |
| Idle money sitting in pot | AI invests to best DeFi protocols |
| Manual records, easy to manipulate | 100% on-chain, fully transparent |
| Limited to family/friends | Global scale, join anyone |

## Key Features

### AI Yield Optimizer
Our AI continuously analyzes DeFi protocols on Mantle Network using real-time data from DeFiLlama. It automatically allocates funds to maximize yield while managing risk.

### Double Yield System
Earn yield from two sources:
1. **Pool Yield** - From monthly deposits invested in DeFi
2. **Collateral Yield** - Your collateral also generates yield during the arisan

### Anti Run-Away Protection
The collateral system ensures every participant stays committed. If someone leaves early, they forfeit their collateral which is distributed to remaining members.

### Low Transaction Fees
Built on Mantle Network, transaction fees are 99% lower than Ethereum mainnet. A typical transaction costs less than $0.05.
