# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about Archa.

## General

### What is Archa?

Archa is a decentralized rotating savings platform (arisan) built on Mantle Network. We combine the traditional Indonesian arisan concept with blockchain technology and AI-powered yield optimization.

### What is arisan?

Arisan is a traditional Indonesian communal savings system where a group contributes a fixed amount regularly, and one member receives the entire pot each period. It rotates until everyone has received once.

### Why blockchain?

Blockchain provides:
- **Transparency** - All transactions are public and verifiable
- **Security** - Smart contracts cannot be manipulated
- **Trust-free** - No need to trust the organizer
- **Global access** - Anyone can participate worldwide

## Getting Started

### What do I need to start?

1. A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
2. MNT tokens for gas fees (very small amount)
3. USDC tokens for deposits and collateral

### How do I get USDC?

For mainnet: Buy on exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, then bridge to Mantle Network.

For testnet: Use our faucet at the bottom of the website to get free test USDC.

### How much does it cost?

Archa has no platform fees. You only pay Mantle Network gas fees which are typically under $0.05 per transaction - 99% cheaper than Ethereum mainnet!

## Participation

### How do I join a pool?

1. Connect your wallet
2. Browse available pools
3. Choose one that fits your budget
4. Deposit the required collateral
5. You're in!

### Can I join multiple pools?

Yes! You can participate in as many pools as you like, provided you can meet all the collateral and deposit requirements.

### What happens if I miss a deposit?

Missing deposits may result in penalties or forfeiture of your collateral. Always ensure you can commit to the full duration before joining.

### Can I leave a pool early?

Leaving early means forfeiting your collateral. This protects other participants who are counting on everyone to complete the cycle.

## Collateral

### Why is collateral required?

Collateral ensures commitment. In traditional arisan, social pressure keeps people honest. In a global, anonymous system, economic incentives serve the same purpose.

### How much collateral do I need?

Typically 2x the monthly deposit amount. Check the specific pool for exact requirements.

### When do I get my collateral back?

After successfully completing all deposits throughout the arisan duration. You'll receive your full collateral plus any yield it generated.

### What happens to forfeited collateral?

It's distributed to remaining participants as compensation for the defaulter leaving.

## Yield & AI

### How does the AI work?

Our AI analyzes DeFi protocols on Mantle Network using real-time data from DeFiLlama. It considers APY, TVL, and risk to allocate funds optimally.

### What yield can I expect?

Yields vary based on market conditions. Check the AI Dashboard for current rates. Historical averages on Mantle have ranged from 5-15% APY.

### Is my money safe in DeFi?

We only use established, audited protocols. However, DeFi always carries smart contract risk. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

### Do I earn yield on collateral?

Yes! Your collateral is invested and generates yield throughout the arisan. This is returned with your collateral at completion.

## Technical

### What network does Archa use?

Archa is built on Mantle Network, an Ethereum L2 with very low transaction fees and fast confirmations.

### Are the smart contracts audited?

Our contracts follow OpenZeppelin standards and best practices. A formal audit is planned before mainnet launch.

### Can I see the source code?

Yes! Everything is open source at [github.com/yt2025id-lab/Archa](https://github.com/yt2025id-lab/Archa).

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction failed, what do I do?

Common causes:
- Insufficient MNT for gas
- Insufficient USDC for the action
- Network congestion (wait and retry)

### I can't see my pool

Make sure you're connected to the correct network (Mantle Sepolia for testnet).
