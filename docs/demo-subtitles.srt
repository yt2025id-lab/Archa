00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What if millions of people already understand DeFi...

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
...they just don't know it yet?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What if I told you that millions of Indonesians
have been practicing decentralized finance for decades...

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
...they just call it something else.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Meet Arisan - Indonesia's traditional
rotating savings system.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Every month, a group of friends pool their money together,
and one person takes home the pot.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's been building trust and community for generations.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But traditional arisan has problems.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What happens when someone wins early and disappears?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What about all that money sitting idle, earning nothing?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And how do you scale trust beyond your inner circle?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Introducing Archa - Arisan On-Chain.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're bringing this proven financial tradition to the blockchain,
powered by AI and built on Mantle Network.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With Archa, your money isn't just sitting there.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Our AI Yield Optimizer automatically invests pool funds
into the best DeFi protocols, generating yield for everyone.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Here's how it works. Let me show you.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
First, choose a pool that fits your budget.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We have starter pools at 10 USDC, standard at 50,
and premium at 100 USDC per month.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Before joining, you deposit collateral -
125% of your remaining payments.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is the magic that prevents run-aways.
If you win early and disappear...

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
...you lose MORE in collateral than you gained.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Connect your wallet, approve USDC, and join.
It's that simple.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Your collateral immediately starts earning yield too!

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now let me show you the real innovation -
our AI Yield Optimizer.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Our AI analyzes real-time data from DeFiLlama,
monitoring 5 major DeFi protocols on Mantle.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lendle, Merchant Moe, Agni Finance,
Minterest, and KTX.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can set your risk tolerance.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The AI then calculates risk-adjusted scores
and recommends the optimal allocation strategy.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
See this? The AI is recommending a diversified strategy
across multiple protocols...

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
...with an expected APY of 8 to 12 percent.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's yield on top of your arisan winnings!

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's look at real numbers.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In a 10-person pool with 50 USDC monthly deposits,
each winner gets 500 USDC plus accumulated yield.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But here's the best part - at the end,
EVERYONE gets their collateral back...

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
...PLUS yield from both the pool AND their collateral.
In Archa, there are no losers.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Archa is live on Mantle Sepolia testnet.
All contracts are deployed and verified.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Archa transforms a centuries-old tradition
into a modern DeFi powerhouse.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
